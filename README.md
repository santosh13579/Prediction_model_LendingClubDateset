# Prediction_model_LendingClubDateset
 # 1. Introduction
  The objective is to use the loan data to build a model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off) and interpret the results to find the factors which affect the result. The  goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off, in order to minimize the risks of loan defaults for the company. I also would like to find the most important factors in making decisions about lending.
  # 2. Data Set
  As the data size is large so I did not upload here. I used the  finanacial data provided by Lending Club of 2015. You can download this dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pf8P-omhEL7VZDI-LJMHP7h0aNuVRM71These
  # 3. File Descriptions
  This problem is a binary classification as I have only two classes to predict
  ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb: Notebook experiment for the ETL pipelines
  ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb: Notebook experiment for the machine learning pipelines
  data/process_data.py: The ETL pipeline used to process data in preparation for model building.
  models/train_classifier.py: The Machine Learning pipeline used to fit, tune, evaluate, and export the model to a Python pickle
  app/templates/~.html: HTML pages for the web app.
  run.py: Start the Python server for the web app and prepare visualizations.
