# Prediction_model_LendingClubDateset
    # This project is for the prediction model for the charge off based on the finanacial data provided by Lending Club of 2015
 # 1. Introduction
  The objective is to use the loan data to build a model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off) and interpret the results to find the factors which affect the result.
  # 2. Data Set
  As the data size is large so I did not upload here. You can download this dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pf8P-omhEL7VZDI-LJMHP7h0aNuVRM71These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information
