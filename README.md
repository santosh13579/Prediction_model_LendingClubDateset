# Prediction_model_LendingClubDateset
 # 1. Introduction
  The objective is to use the loan data to build a model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off) and interpret the results to find the factors which affect the result. The  goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off, in order to minimize the risks of loan defaults for the company. I also would like to find the most important factors in making decisions about lending.
  # 2. Data Set
  As the data size is large so I did not upload here. I used the  finanacial data provided by Lending Club of 2015. You can download this dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pf8P-omhEL7VZDI-LJMHP7h0aNuVRM71These
  # 3. File Descriptions

    
    
    Keyperformance_Ind.ipynb: Notebook experiment for analyzing the data set to identify the key points that affects the prediction model. 
    Main_Model.ipynb: Notebook experiment for  step by step for building a machine learning algorith for the prediction of loan defaulters 
    based on certain variables present in the dataset.
